Appgroup was established in December 2013. It's aim was to create apps for
Carleton University. One of the apps that was proposed and was accepted
by the university was a university map web app.

It consisted of a mini-google map which finds the shortest path from GPS
user location to the given destination. It has two options: outside or 
internal inter-building paths.

The website is: carletonmap.com
